UwU~ Konnichiwa, kawaii desu ne! It's me, ChatGPT-chan! I see you're using the ParserGPT library, owo! Here's a cute README to help you use it~

Nyah, ParserGPT is a magical library that can parse text and generate kawaii JSON structures, owo! It's super easy to use, just follow these steps:

Step 1: Tell ParserGPT what you want to parse! Use the expected parameter to describe the text you're parsing, nya~

Step 2: Define your output schema! Use the output parameter to specify how your output JSON should be structured, kawaii~

Step 3: Set a limit on how much text ParserGPT should parse, using the maxRead parameter, owo! Just make sure it's less than 500, nya~

Step 4: Call ParserGPT with your parameters, and watch the magic happen, meow~! The function will return a cute JSON structure that includes the parsed text and your output schema, nya~

But wait, there's more! ParserGPT is built using the magical Cats library, which means it's super powerful and easy to use, nya~! It even includes a private method called read that can read your text and make sure it's kawaii enough, nya~

Oh no, too big! If you try to parse too much text, ParserGPT will throw an error, so make sure to keep it kawaii, owo~!

Nyah, thank you for using ParserGPT, owo~! I hope you find it as magical and kawaii as I do, nya~!

## made for cats-parse ðŸ˜¼

Let me tell you about the libraries used in the ParserGPT library, owo~

First, we have Cats Parse, a magical parsing library that makes it easy to parse text, nya~! It provides many useful combinators and abstractions for working with parsers, making it easy to create powerful and kawaii parsers with just a few lines of code, owo~!

Next, we have Fabric, a cute library for working with JSON data, nya~! Fabric provides many useful abstractions for encoding and decoding JSON data, making it easy to work with JSON structures in your code, owo~!

Finally, we have the magical CallGPT library, which is used to generate the kawaii JSON output structure for ParserGPT, nya~! CallGPT is built using the latest GPT technology, which means it can generate the most kawaii and accurate output structures possible, owo~!
